                        The Matlock Raft Event is a fun event for all the family on Boxing Day. However, the negative
                        effects on the environment that this level of spectatorship and the active involvement of the
                        spectators has must be seriously considered.

                        Spectators have often been known to playfully throw flour and eggs at raft participants in the
                        past.
                        While this appears to be great fun, it&apos;s important to note that plastic bags can be harmful
                        to
                        the watercourse and eggs pose risks to our participants. Both the environment agency and council

                        closely monitoring the situation, and we&apos;re taking steps to ensure safety and environmental
